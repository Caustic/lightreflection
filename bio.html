My interested in photography began in 1969 when I took a European discharge from the US Army and drove an old Volkswagen van across Europe and North Africa. One of my first pictures was of an impoverished people on a train station in Yugoslavia and is still a favorite. I remember thinking "there's a picture" and rushing to get my camera (Pentax Spotmatic) out and set up to capture the moment as my train was pulling away.</b>

I didn't shoot seriously until I started Scuba Diving in 1978 at which time I put my Spotmatic in Ikelite housing. Eight years later I was introduced to the desert by a friend and started shooting landscape photography. My preference is to record the earth without signs of civilization so you will not find people and/or man-made objects in most of my pictures. Living in Hawaii on the Big Island since 1997, I spend most of my photographic time shooting Hawaii Above and Hawaii Below Water. Although I love living in Hawaii, as a photographer, my heart is in the desert and the American West.
<br><br> 
I have taken well over 20,000 pictures in the last 20 years. And yet I have vivid recollections of most of my favorites - racing across the sand dunes to beat the sun; timing a wave; waiting for the best moment in a sunrise; or trying to get into the right position to shoot an underwater scene. Recognizing a potential picture, positioning the camera, and composing these shots are deeply ingrained in my memory and I relive them every time I see the picture. I would imagine that other photographers have the same memories.
